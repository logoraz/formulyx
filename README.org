A Highly extensible formulation chemistry software tool written in =Common Lisp=.

=WIP:= Project is in the very early development stages...

#+html: <p align="center"> <img src="assets/common-lisp.svg" width="200" /> </p>

Create an Advanced Formulation Chemistry Software Tool for the creation of
Formulas, Specifications, Raw Materials, and Regulatory data.


** Goals

I've decided to first start out by building simple tools needed for formulation,
such as the calculation of Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance/Deviation, create a simple
UI, then slowly add on more advanced features like a formula builder, regulatory
intelligence, and AI assistance..

- [ ] Implement HLB & HLD calculation backend
- [ ] Scaffold initial database for surfactants/oils 
- [ ] Build unit test framework
- [ ] Build documentation system
- [ ] Build out initial UI (`cl-electron`)
- [ ] Executable creation


** Installation

#+begin_src sh

  # Clone the repo
  $ git clone https://github.com/logoraz/formulyx.git
  $ cd formulyx
  # Load in your Lisp REPL (SBCL only for now)
  $ sbcl

#+end_src


#+begin_src lisp

  ;; Load system
  (asdf:load-system :formulyx)

  ;; Test system
  (asdf:test-system :formulyx)

#+end_src
